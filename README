NAME
    Encode::Wordlist::PGP - convert hex values to/from PGP Word List format

DESCRIPTION
    The PGP Word List is a list of words for conveying data bytes in a clear
    unambiguous way via a voice channel. They are analogous in purpose to
    the NATO phonetic alphabet used by pilots, except a longer list of words
    is used, each word corresponding to one of the 256 unique numeric byte
    values. This module provides functions to convert between those byte
    values and words.

METHODS
    See perldoc in module.
